# CopiedTexts
**CopiedTexts** is a mini iOS app to keep track of texts copied by the user and stored in the pasteboard / clipboard on the device.

## Description
A block of text copied on an iOS device is temporarily stored in its pasteboard / clipboard, which allows you to then paste it on an app.

**CopiedTexts** internally stores all the texts once stored in the pasteboard.
You can view the list of the stored texts, copy it again if you want, and delete it if it is not needed.
