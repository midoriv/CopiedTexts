# CopiedTexts
**CopiedTexts** is a mini iOS app to keep track of texts copied by the user which are then stored in the pasteboard / clipboard on the device.

## Description
A block of texts copied on an iOS device is temporarily stored in its pasteboard / clipboard, allowing you to paste it on an app. 

**CopiedTexts** internally stores all the texts once stored in the pasteboard. 
When you want to keep some important notes, address, phone numbers etc, you can keep them in the app without pasting them somewhere else.

You can view the list of the stored texts, copy again if you want, and delete if it is not needed.

## How It Works
### 1. Store a copied text
The demonstration below shows that a text copied on Safari is automatically stored on the **CopiedTexts** app. 
The first screen is one you see when the app first launches.
After copying a block of text on an app (like Safari) the text is stored in this app when you reopen the app.

### 2. Copy a text stored in the app
You can copy any text stored in the **CopiedTexts** and use it by pasting it on an app.
The following demonstrates how to copy a text, a URL, from the list, to paste it on Safari's address bar to open up the webpage at the URL.

### 3. Delete texts
The copied texts would pile up as you use this app. You can delete unnecessary texts from the list simply by swiping from right to left hand side as shown below.
